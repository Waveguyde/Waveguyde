Hi, Iâ€™m @Waveguyde,
Iâ€™m interested in the dynamics of the middle atmosphere. Particularly atmospheric gravity waves are the focus of my research.
Also, I love to do time-frequency analysis using continuous wavelet transform or Hilbert-Huang transform.
I do have great fun when visualizing observations with various instruments and also research results.
